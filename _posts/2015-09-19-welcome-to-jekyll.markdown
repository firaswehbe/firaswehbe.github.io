This is the first "post" on this website. I am building it using
[Jekyll][jekyll]. So far installing and running the `gh-pages` gem makes it easy
to build and test this. Just run the following commands in your repo.

{% highlight bash %}
jekyll new .
jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}

The second line launches a web server and auto-generates your site when a file
is updated. 

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets with support for syntax
highlighting (the following is python):

{% highlight python %}
import os
print("hello world")
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of
Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If
you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help
repository][jekyll-help].
